# gomotion2015

This project was used as a practical introduction to Golang for my talk at [Codemotion 2015](http://rome2015.codemotionworld.com/).

The app is not just an example, (believe it or not) it works for real! The app exposes a system binary, for example `dig`, via an HTTP interface.

This is just an example of something you can create with Go. The project was used to introduce Golang features and design to a beginner audience, therefore expect the final app to be fairly simple. Each commit of this repo represents a baby-step towards the final app.
